# TritonHacks 2025 <br> Web Development Starter Kit

This is the starter kit for the 2024-2025 TritonHacks hosted by [CS Foreach](https://csforeach.org/) during Spring Quarter. 

TritonHacks happens every year at UCSD, calling high schoolers from all over San Diego to join a weekend hackathon. Throughout the event, students get starter kits from us to craft cool projects linked to a particular theme. It's a chance for them to dive into coding, solve problems, and spark creativity while having fun together in a collaborative setup.

The theme for this Hackathon was nature.
